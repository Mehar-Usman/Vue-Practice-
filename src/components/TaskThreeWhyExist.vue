  <p class="text-center pt-6 flex flex-wrap">
    Quality education is a big challenge in Pakistan. Good institutes are only available in oig cities and the cost of sending your kid there is out of the average person's income in Pakistan. Public schools lack adequate infrastructure and skilled teachers. Overall, traditional education institutes work on a one size fits all principle. Therefore, we strongly believe that an adaptive learning platform that could offer a superior uniform learning experience to the masses would be a huge success in a country like Pakistan.
