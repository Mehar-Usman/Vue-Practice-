<!-- We use the grid layout utility classes in Tailwind CSS to create a responsive grid with one column on small screens (sm:), two columns on medium screens (md:), and three columns on larger screens.
The gap-4 class adds a gap between the cards to create some spacing between them.
Each card is wrapped in a div with the flex and items-stretch classes to make sure the card's height is determined by its content and stretches to fill the available space inside the grid cell.
The bg-white, p-4, and rounded-lg classes are used to add some styling to the cards, such as a white background, padding, and rounded corners.
The flex-grow class is used on the inner div to make it flex and grow to fill the available space inside the card.
We use the text-xl and font-semibold classes to make the card titles bold and larger in size.
With this Tailwind CSS code, you get the same result as the previous example, with equal width and height cards that are responsive to different amounts of content. -->
